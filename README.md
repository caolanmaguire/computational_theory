## Abstract

This semester-long project explores fundamental concepts in computational theory, examining both classical and contemporary approaches to computation. The work investigates binary representations, cryptographic hashing, prime number theory, and Turing machines to establish connections between historical computational principles and modern applications. Through practical implementations and theoretical analysis, this project contributes to the understanding of computational complexity and its implications for computer science as described by Sipser (2012) in his seminal work on the theory of computation.-->

## Task 1: Binary Representations
Investigation of numerical encoding systems and their computational properties.

## Task 2: Hash Functions
Analysis of mapping techniques for data integrity and security applications.

## Task 3: SHA256
Implementation and examination of the SHA256 cryptographic hash function which was standardized by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and remains fundamental to modern security systems (NIST, 2015).

## Task 4: Prime Numbers
Exploration of prime number theory and its applications in cryptography and number theory.

## Task 5: Mathematical Roots
Investigation of computational approaches to root-finding algorithms.

## Task 6: Proof of Work
Analysis of computational challenge systems used in blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies.

## Task 7: Turing Machines
Implementation of theoretical models of computation based on Turing's original concept.

## Task 8: Computational Complexity
Exploration of algorithmic efficiency and complexity classes following the framework established by Cook (1971) in his groundbreaking work on NP-completeness.

## Theoretical Framework
